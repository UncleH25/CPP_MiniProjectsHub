# üìö C++ Mini Projects Hub
Welcome to the central repository for my small C++ projects!

Each project was created to practise and reinforce a specific concept in C++ programming. This hub provides an easy way to navigate through them, understand their purpose, and see what was learnt in each.
## üóÇÔ∏è Project List by Learning Outcome
### üî§ Basics of a C++ Program 
The following programs focus on the following core aspects:
* Understanding the structure of a basic C++ program
* Using `#include <iostream>` and the `std` namespace
* Basic declaring and initialising of varibles (`string`,`int`,`char`)
* Working with `const` values for fixed data
* Accpeting user input with `cin` and displaying output with `cout`
* Performing basic arithmetic operations (excluding the modulo operator)
* Writing clean, well-commented code

These mini-projects are designed to build confidence and fluency in writing, compiling, and running simple C++ programs.


## Project 1
[**Simple USD/ZAR Currency Converter**](https://github.com/UncleH25/Simple-USD-ZAR-Currency-Converter)

*A basic C++ program that converts US Dollars (USD) to South African Rands (ZAR) using a fixed exchange rate.*

*Allows users to input an amount in USD and calculates the equivalent amount in ZAR based on a predefined exchange rate.*
